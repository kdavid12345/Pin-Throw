## Features
- **Three Difficulty Levels**:
  - **Easy**: Fewer pins and slower rotation speed.
  - **Medium**: More pins and moderate rotation speed.
  - **Hard**: Even more pins, faster rotation, and one throw adds two pins to the circle.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Pins rotate around a central circle, and players must time their throws carefully to avoid collisions.
- **Win/Lose Conditions**:
  - **Win**: Successfully place all pins without collisions.
  - **Lose**: Pins collide, ending the game.
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for pin throws, wins, and losses.
- **Visual Feedback**: The screen changes color to indicate wins (green) or losses (red).
- **Replayability**: Players can restart the game or exit after a win or loss.
